## How It All Started

Back in 2007, a Seattle-based journalist and artist named Gabriel Campanario started a group on Flickr for people who loved drawing on location. It was a simple idea, but it took off. By 2009, it had blossomed into a full-blown nonprofit and a global community with a cool manifesto: draw what you see, right where you see it, and tell the story of your surroundings.

## The Urban Sketcher's Code

The community has a simple philosophy that keeps everyone on the same page:
- We draw on location, capturing what we see from direct observation.
- Our drawings tell the story of our surroundings, the places we live, and the places we visit.
- We value the process, not just the final product.
- We support one another and share our work online.
- We are a global community of artists, respecting all skill levels and styles.

## What’s in Their Sketch Kit?

Most urban sketchers pack light. Think small sketchbooks, a few trusty pens, and maybe a compact watercolor set. The goal is to have gear that’s easy to carry and use anywhere, whether you’re standing on a bustling street corner or tucked away in a cozy café. It’s all about being ready when inspiration strikes.

## A Worldwide Community of Artists

Today, Urban Sketchers has official chapters in hundreds of cities all over the world. Artists connect through local meetups (often called "sketchcrawls"), an annual international symposium, and, of course, social media. What started as a little Flickr group has become one of the most welcoming and exciting art movements out there.

## Documenting Life in Real-Time

Forget sterile studios. Urban sketching is all about capturing life as it unfolds right in front of you. Sketchers act like visual journalists, drawing everything from construction sites that change the skyline to the daily buzz at a local market. It's about documenting the living, breathing story of a place.

## See Your City in a New Light

Sketching outside forces you to slow down and really *look* at your surroundings. You'll start noticing the small things you'd normally walk right past—the unique architecture, the play of light and shadow, the little human moments happening all around. It’s a fantastic way to rediscover your own town and see it with fresh eyes.

## Ready to Join?

Don't worry about your skill level. Whether you're a seasoned artist or just starting, you're welcome. The whole point is to enjoy the process and connect with others, not to create a perfect masterpiece. Most cities have groups that host "sketchcrawls," which are basically fun, casual meetups to draw together.
